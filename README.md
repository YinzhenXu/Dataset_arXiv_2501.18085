Data descriptions:

This dataset provides the distribution amplitudes (DAs) of mesons, including: 

pseudoscalar mesons: pi^+, K, D, B, eta_s, D_s, B_s, eta_b, B_c 

vector mesons: pi^+, K^\*, D^\*, B^\*, phi, D^\*_s, B^\*_s, Upslion, B^\*_c 

Data format:

Each data file consists of two columns. The first column represents x, the second column gives the corresponding value of DAs phi(x)

File names:

uu_PS_fit1.dat: pi meson's DAs, with fit1.

uu_PS_up.dat, uu_PS_low.dat: pi meson's DAs, upper bound and the lower bound.

uu_VC_longitudinally_fit1.dat: rho^+ meson's longitudinally DAs, with fit1. 

us_PS_fit1.dat: K meson's DAs, with fit1.

â€¦

A sample Mathematica notebook (Plot.nb) is provided to demonstrate how to load and visualize the data.
